        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal of mastering <b><u>HTML</u></b>, <b><u>CSS</u></b>, <b><u>JavaScript</u></b>, and <b><u>React</u></b> through the Team Treehouse Tech Degree reflects a strategic and practical approach to advancing my skills as a Front-End Web Developer. This comprehensive learning journey not only equips me with the technical expertise required in the industry but also nurtures my problem-solving abilities through hands-on projects.</p>
        <p>As I aspire to work remotely from my hometown Athens, after being abroad for seven years, this endeavor becomes a meaningful pursuit that aligns with my personal and professional aspirations. Remote work offers the freedom to balance my career with the comfort of being in familiar surroundings, and Athens provides a vibrant backdrop for a lifestyle that seamlessly integrates work and personal life. My dream of contributing to a great company while remotely situated in Athens is a testament to the growing opportunities in the tech industry for talented individuals who value flexibility and diverse work environments.</p>
